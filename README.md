# QPQE: Quantum Post-Quantum Encryption for Bitcoin

QPQE (Quantum Post-Quantum Encryption) is a quantum-secure Bitcoin wallet prototype developed for the Bitcoin 2025 Hackathon by AI Quantum Cypher, leveraging IBM Qiskit for quantum random number generation injected into both a proprietary Kyber-like post-quantum encryption and the private key generation process, securing Bitcoin private keys against quantum threats. Features include a 16-qubit quantum circuit for randomness, ECDSA Bitcoin address generation, visualizations (text-based circuit, measurement distribution, key lengths comparison), and a proprietary authentication framework [PROPRIETARY FEATURE]. Future plans include real Kyber integration, Dilithium signatures with quantum randomness injected into key generation, NextMind’s unreleased visual cortex BCI authentication, and Bitcoin testnet transactions, with broader goals of a crypto bridge and mass wallet adoption [PROPRIETARY PLAN]. We’re seeking $250k-$1M for NIST standards testing, IBM Quantum API integration (currently $90/hour), and further development.

## Setup
1. Open in Google Colab: [Link to your notebook, if shared]
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install qiskit qiskit-aer pycryptodome python-bitcoinlib cryptography matplotlib

Run the notebook to generate wallet details and visualizations.

Features
